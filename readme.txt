Features in these scripts:

	1- Used in this script beautifulsoup to web scrape the Unicode site for the emojis
	I didn't use a manually defined one, you can find the HTML files in emojiproject/htmlfiles.

	
	2- Implemented natural language processing techniques to extract useful words from
	the input.

	3- I made sure that the search process was efficient as I split the data into two dictionaries
	one dictionary that contains simple keys like "Cat" and these single-word elements allow for 
	fast look up.

	4- Implemented spellcheck to make the user experience smoother.



Thank you!!
