Arab American University Emoji challenge


Requirements :
	
	Visual studio code
	Python 3.10 installed MUST DO
	
	Open the requirements.py file and then use pip install and run the pip install
	
	Then after that run the script to download the required NLTK packages. 


How to run the Program:
	
	After that, you should activate the virtual environment by typing this in the terminal.
	
	.emojiproj/scripts/activate


How to use the program:
	
	Just run the terminal and use it easily.



Features in these scripts:

	1- Used in this script beautifulsoup to web scrape the Unicode site for the emojis
	I didn't use a manually defined one, you can find the HTML files in emojiproject/htmlfiles.

	
	2- Implemented natural language processing techniques to extract useful words from
	the input.

	3- I made sure that the searching process was efficient as I split the data into two dictionaries
	one dictionary that contains simple keys like "Cat" " These single word elements allow for 
	fast look up.

	4- Implemented spellcheck to make the user experience easier.


Worth mentioning:

	Sorry for the poor user experience I tried to make this app a web app but I didn't have enough or 
	the experience to do it.

	You can see the web app design by opening ConceptFrontEnd.png



Thank you!!
